## Showcase

To showcase what it can do, here's a small clip of writing a component which exits the canvas when `'q'` is pressed, and showing how ccanvas works in the process.

Simplified version of stuff that happened:

1. ccanvas starts
2. Creates the master space `/1`
3. Loads a component as specified in command args at `/1/2`
4. Component subscribes to all key presses
5. Component tells the main canvas to exit when `'q'` is pressed

The end
